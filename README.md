# Speech Emotion Recognition
Speech emotion recognition using different CNN models
## Problem Statement
Problem Statement
Speech is the most natural way of expressing ourselves as humans. It is only natural then to extend this communication medium to computer applications. We define speech emotion recognition (SER) systems as a collection of methodologies that process and classify speech signals to detect the embedded emotions.
## Overview
Build a CNN architecture of your own, a simple example is shown in the figure. For the time domain or frequency domain feature space, the feature space will be 1 dimensional, therefore in the architecture we will be using 1D convolutions. While in melspectogram feature space, the audio is represented as an image, therefore we will be using 2D convolutions. N.B. Do not use the built-in models, but you can implement them from scratch.
